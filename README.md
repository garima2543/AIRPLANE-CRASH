# Airplane Crash Analysis | Power BI & Python
# Project Overview

This project analyzes global airplane crash data to uncover trends in crash frequency, fatalities, aircraft types, and geographic distribution. The analysis combines Python for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Power BI for interactive visualization and insights.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills, from raw data processing to dashboard-driven storytelling.

# Objectives

-Analyze historical airplane crash data
